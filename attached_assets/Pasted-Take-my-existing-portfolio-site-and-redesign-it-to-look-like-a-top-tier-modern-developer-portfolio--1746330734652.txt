Take my existing portfolio site and redesign it to look like a top-tier, modern developer portfolio — similar in quality to sites from big tech engineers (like Stripe, Vercel, or Apple devs).

🎯 Design Goals:
- Elegant, responsive layout with animated elements and polished UI
- Full-screen header with hero animation, Focus Pocus mascot floating subtly
- Clean, modular design — use Flexbox/Grid as needed
- Smooth transitions and scroll animations (AOS, GSAP, or basic CSS/JS)

📚 Sections (Visually Elevated):
1. **Hero/Home**
   - Full-screen welcome with my name, tagline (e.g. “Developer of Magical Software”), CTA buttons
   - Background animation (particles.js, gradient shift, or subtle looping video)
   - Floating Focus Pocus mascot and scroll arrow

2. **About Me**
   - Two-column layout: Photo + Text
   - Add skill icons with hover effects (HTML, JS, Firebase, etc.)
   - Include animated counters for “Years Coding,” “Projects,” etc.

3. **Projects**
   - Each project in its own full-width card
   - Add carousel/lightbox for Focus Pocus UI screenshots
   - Animated section for “Tech Used” (icon list or badges)
   - Focus Pocus entry should use unique branding/magic style — glowing borders, fade-in spell effects

4. **Resume**
   - Stylized timeline view for experience & education
   - Skills section using animated bar graphs or tags
   - Downloadable resume button

5. **Contact**
   - Clean form with floating labels
   - Include working email action (via Formspree or EmailJS)
   - Add LinkedIn/GitHub icons in footer

🎨 Style:
- Dark/light toggle (optional)
- Use bold color highlights: violet, soft gold, indigo (to match Focus Pocus)
- Consistent font (Inter, Poppins, or IBM Plex Mono)

📦 Extra:
- Include all visuals I’ve provided (mascot, screenshots)
- Optimize for fast load (lazy load images, minimal blocking)
- Make sure it's ready to deploy from Replit with 1-click hosting
