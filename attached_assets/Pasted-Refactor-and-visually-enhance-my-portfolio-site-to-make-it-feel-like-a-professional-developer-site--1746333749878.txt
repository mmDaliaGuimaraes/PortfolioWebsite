Refactor and visually enhance my portfolio site to make it feel like a professional developer site, themed around "magic meets tech", and optimized for recruiter viewing.

🧱 STRUCTURE FIXES:
- Fix issue where the "Marcio Guimarães" header is hidden behind the nav bar
  > Add top padding/margin to `.hero-content` (around 100px) so the name is visible on all screen sizes
  > If using `position: absolute` for nav or particles, adjust z-index and layout stacking context properly
- Use flexbox or grid to center `.hero-content` both vertically and horizontally, without overlapping

🎯 STAY SINGLE-PAGE:
- Keep all content in one page
- Add smooth scroll between sections using `scroll-behavior: smooth` in CSS
- Add scrollspy-style nav: highlight the active section in nav bar as user scrolls

🪄 MAGIC + TECH ANIMATIONS:
- Use `particles.js` in the background with a custom theme:
  > Magic colors: deep indigo, glowing blue, soft gold
  > Particle effects: floating sparkles, connecting nodes (tech feel)
- Animate mascot gently floating with a glow and sparkle trail on hover
- Animate section reveals using [AOS.js](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) (e.g., fade-up, slide-in for projects/resume/about)
- Animate buttons with subtle pulsing or gradient borders on hover

🎨 VISUAL STYLE:
- Hero section: full height, centered text, background particles
- Font: use `Poppins` for headings and `IBM Plex Mono` or `Inter` for body text
- Button style: rounded corners, glowing borders, hover transitions
- Add a dark/light toggle button with a moon/sun icon
- Use magical gradients (e.g. indigo to violet) as section dividers or footer

📱 MOBILE OPTIMIZATION:
- Collapse nav into a hamburger menu using vanilla JS
- Stack hero elements on smaller screens
- Ensure all project images scale correctly

📸 MEDIA + VISUALS:
- All Focus Pocus mascot and screen images should animate in with `fade-up` or `zoom-in`
- Include lightbox effect for screenshot gallery
- Ensure alt text is descriptive and accessible

🧠 EXTRAS:
- Add a “Back to Top” button in bottom-right corner that appears on scroll
- Include subtle parallax effect on hero if possible
- Animate page load with a short intro animation (mascot wand wave or text flicker)

📁 OUTPUT FILES:
- index.html — updated structure with fixes and section IDs
- style.css — new layout styles, animations, scroll effects
- script.js — handles scrollspy, dark mode toggle, animations
- Include necessary CDN links (particles.js, AOS.js, Google Fonts)

Comment code clearly so I can edit later.
